# Using the Async SignalRGB Client

Starting from version 1.0.0, signalrgb-python includes a native asyncio-based client that allows you to integrate SignalRGB functionality with async code. This is particularly useful for applications built on asyncio, such as Home Assistant integrations or asynchronous web applications.

## üöÄ Basic Usage

The `AsyncSignalRGBClient` provides the same functionality as the synchronous client but with async/await syntax:

```python
import asyncio
from signalrgb import AsyncSignalRGBClient

async def main():
    # Create a client
    async with AsyncSignalRGBClient() as client:
        # Get current effect
        effect = await client.get_current_effect()
        print(f"Current effect: {effect.attributes.name}")

        # List available effects
        effects = await client.get_effects()
        print(f"Available effects: {len(effects)}")

        # Apply a random effect
        new_effect = await client.apply_random_effect()
        print(f"Applied effect: {new_effect.attributes.name}")

# Run the async code
asyncio.run(main())
```

## üìä Comparison with Synchronous Client

The async client provides the same functionality as the synchronous client but with async/await syntax:

| Synchronous Client        | Asynchronous Client               |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `client.get_effects()`    | `await client.get_effects()`      |
| `client.apply_effect(id)` | `await client.apply_effect(id)`   |
| `client.brightness = 50`  | `await client.set_brightness(50)` |
| `client.enabled = True`   | `await client.set_enabled(True)`  |

## üîÑ Properties vs Methods

Unlike the synchronous client, the asynchronous client uses methods instead of properties for read/write operations, since properties in Python can't be async:

| Synchronous Client                 | Asynchronous Client                         |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `client.brightness`                | `await client.get_brightness()`             |
| `client.brightness = 50`           | `await client.set_brightness(50)`           |
| `client.enabled`                   | `await client.get_enabled()`                |
| `client.enabled = True`            | `await client.set_enabled(True)`            |
| `client.current_layout`            | `await client.get_current_layout()`         |
| `client.current_layout = "layout"` | `await client.set_current_layout("layout")` |

## üè† Integration with Home Assistant

The async client is particularly well-suited for integrating with Home Assistant, which uses asyncio for its operations:

```python
from homeassistant.components.light import LightEntity
from signalrgb import AsyncSignalRGBClient

class SignalRGBLight(LightEntity):
    def __init__(self, client):
        self._client = client
        self._name = "SignalRGB"
        self._state = False
        self._brightness = 0

    async def async_turn_on(self, **kwargs):
        await self._client.set_enabled(True)
        if "brightness" in kwargs:
            # Home Assistant brightness is 0-255, SignalRGB is 0-100
            brightness = round(kwargs["brightness"] / 255 * 100)
            await self._client.set_brightness(brightness)
        self._state = True

    async def async_turn_off(self, **kwargs):
        await self._client.set_enabled(False)
        self._state = False

    async def async_update(self):
        self._state = await self._client.get_enabled()
        self._brightness = await self._client.get_brightness()
```

See the `examples/home_assistant_example.py` file for a more complete Home Assistant integration example.

## üì¶ Context Manager Support

The async client supports being used as an async context manager, which ensures proper cleanup of resources:

```python
async with AsyncSignalRGBClient() as client:
    # client is automatically closed when exiting this block
    await client.get_effects()
```

You can also manually close the client:

```python
client = AsyncSignalRGBClient()
try:
    await client.get_effects()
finally:
    await client.aclose()
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling

The async client raises the same exceptions as the synchronous client. Always use try/except blocks to catch and handle potential errors:

```python
try:
    await client.apply_effect_by_name("nonexistent_effect")
except NotFoundError:
    print("Effect not found")
except ConnectionError:
    print("Connection error")
except APIError as e:
    print(f"API error: {e}")
```

## üîÑ Backward Compatibility

The synchronous client is still available and fully functional. In fact, it now uses the async client internally, running operations in a synchronized manner. This allows existing code to continue working without changes.

If you're using the client in a synchronous context but need to call it from async code in some places, you can mix approaches:

```python
# In synchronous code
from signalrgb import SignalRGBClient

client = SignalRGBClient()
effects = client.get_effects()

# Later, in an async context
async def async_function():
    # Use the async client directly
    async with AsyncSignalRGBClient() as async_client:
        await async_client.apply_effect_by_name("some_effect")
```

## üöÄ Performance Considerations

The async client can offer better performance in async applications, especially when:

- Making multiple concurrent requests
- Integrating with other async code like Home Assistant
- Operating in event-loop based applications
- Processing many effects/devices simultaneously

It avoids blocking the event loop while waiting for API responses, allowing your application to remain responsive while processing SignalRGB operations.

## üí° Advanced Example: Effect Cycling

Here's a more advanced example that cycles through all available effects, displaying each for a specified duration:

```python
import asyncio
from signalrgb import AsyncSignalRGBClient

async def cycle_effects(duration=5):
    """Cycle through all effects, displaying each for the specified duration."""
    async with AsyncSignalRGBClient() as client:
        effects = await client.get_effects()
        print(f"Cycling through {len(effects)} effects...")

        for effect in effects:
            print(f"Applying effect: {effect.attributes.name}")
            await client.apply_effect(effect.id)
            await asyncio.sleep(duration)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(cycle_effects(duration=3))
```

This example demonstrates how to leverage the async capabilities to create a non-blocking effect showcase application.
