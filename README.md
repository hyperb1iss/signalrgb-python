### Command-line Interface

signalrgb-python comes with an intuitive command-line interface for easy interaction with your SignalRGB setup.

```bash
# List all available effects
signalrgb list-effects

# Get details of a specific effect
signalrgb get-effect "Psychedelic Dream"

# Apply an effect
signalrgb apply-effect "Rave Visualizer"

# Get the current effect
signalrgb current-effect

# Set brightness level (0-100)
signalrgb brightness 75

# Get current brightness level
signalrgb brightness

# Enable the canvas
signalrgb enable

# Disable the canvas
signalrgb disable
```

You can also specify a custom host and port:

```bash
signalrgb --host hyperia.home --port 16038 list-effects
```

For a full list of available commands and options, use:

```bash
signalrgb --help
```

### Python Library

Integrate signalrgb-python into your own Python projects with ease:

```python
from signalrgb.client import SignalRGBClient

# Initialize the client
client = SignalRGBClient(host="hyperia.home", port=16038)

# List all effects
effects = client.get_effects()
for effect in effects:
    print(f"Effect: {effect.attributes.name}")

# Apply an effect
client.apply_effect_by_name("Rain")

# Get current effect
current_effect = client.get_current_effect()
print(f"Current effect: {current_effect.attributes.name}")

# Control brightness
client.brightness = 50
print(f"Current brightness: {client.brightness}")

# Enable/disable the canvas
client.enabled = True
print(f"Canvas enabled: {client.enabled}")
```

### Error Handling

The client provides custom exceptions for different types of errors:

```python
from signalrgb.client import SignalRGBClient, ConnectionError, APIError, EffectNotFoundError

client = SignalRGBClient()

try:
    client.apply_effect_by_name("Non-existent Effect")
except ConnectionError as e:
    print(f"Connection failed: {e}")
except EffectNotFoundError as e:
    print(f"Effect not found: {e}")
except APIError as e:
    print(f"API error occurred: {e}")
```
